              Dr. Bochen Jia is an Associate Professor at the University of
              Michigan-Dearborn, and his research focuses on occupational issues
              related to worker capacity changes due to modern risk factors. He
              is currently working on quantifying the impacts of exoskeletons on
              worker performance and safety using digital human modeling
              technology. He is particularly interested in understanding the
              ability and limitations of human modeling technology in assessing
              various human-exoskeleton interactions. Dr. Jia is currently
              working as a task-group leader at ASTM International Standards
              Organization to lead the efforts of establishing a practice to
              guide the proper use of digital human models in the design and
              evaluation of exoskeleton devices in both occupational and
              nonoccupational settings. Armed with strong research advantages
              for the automobile industry in Michigan, his research efforts also
              extend to ergonomic issues associated with occupant behaviors
              under complex driving conditions with advanced technologies, such
              as connected and autonomous vehicle technologies. He is working on
              understanding occupantsâ€™ in-vehicle physical activities during
              prolonged driving.
